# Json-SQL-Database-Storage
A Java resource that can take JSON data, and transform it to be stored in an SQL Database, and vise-versa.

Edit, implement, or take inspiration from this as you wish.

#Important Notes
It is imperative that you implement your own Asynchronous calling of checkConnection within the getConnection method. A connection-pooled version of this would be more optimal.
